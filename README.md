# philosophers

What you should understand to succeed this project:<br>
• One or more philosophers are sitting at a round table either eating, either thinking,<br>
either sleeping. While they are eating, they do not think or sleep; while thinking<br>
they don’t eat or sleep; and, of course, while sleeping, they do not eat or think.<br>
• The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.<br>
• There are some forks on the table. Serving and eating spaghetti with a single fork<br>
is very inconvenient, so the philosophers will eat with two forks, one for each hand.<br>
• Each time a philosopher finish eating, they will drop their forks and start sleeping.<br>
Once they have finished sleeping, they will start thinking. The simulation stops<br>
when a philosopher dies.<br>
• Every philosopher needs to eat and they should never starve.<br>
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.<br>
• Philosophers don’t know when another philosopher is about to die.<br>
• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!<br>
